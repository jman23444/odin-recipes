            Lasagna was one of the first dishes I learned to make in college. 
            The early attempts were based on an easy lasagna recipe that kept 
            dishes to a minimum but still provided plenty of leftovers. When I 
            would cook it, the irresistible aroma of melting cheese and robust 
            pasta sauce would waft down the hall. It earned me a reputation as 
            the cook on my floor. Before long, I started doubling the lasagna 
            ingredients to make it in a huge disposable panâ€”perfect for feeding 
            a crowd or for holiday occasions.
